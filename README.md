# GPR_Epi_Modeling
This file serves as supporting material for the paper "Modeling Epidemic Spread: A Gaussian Process Regression Approach."

The data are from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing?ref=hir.harvard.edu.

The project consists of five files. 

The file Modeling_Prediction_GPR.ipynb provides the code for Example 2 in the paper "Modeling Epidemic Spread: A Gaussian Process Regression Approach."

The file Modeling_Prediction_Comp.ipynb compares GPR with K-NN, polynomial regression, and neural networks for modeling and prediction, providing the code for Examples 1 and 2 in the paper "Modeling Epidemic Spread: A Gaussian Process Regression Approach." 

The file GPR_Modeling_Sen_Ana.ipynb presents a sensitivity analysis on the impact of infection data pre-processing on modeling using GPR. 

The file GPR_Prediction_Sen_Ana.ipynb contains a sensitivity analysis on the impact of infection data pre-processing on prediction using GPR.

The file Sensitivity_Analysis_Summary.ipynb contains the complete results of the sensitivity analyses, including plots where each analysis is visualized within the same plot for direct comparison.
